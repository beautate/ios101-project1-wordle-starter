## Notes

This was a pretty challenging first project. I'm a data science major so I'm used to running scripts and manipulating data so this was my first heavy use of OOP since intro courses a couple of years ago. I also struggled with some of the conventions of swift and dropping into a project that was largely already built out. I worked around these challenges by consulting with the instructional team for big picture guidance, utilizing chat gpt and youtube to make sure that I understood variables, functions, closures, and some of the deeper syntax, and a lot of trial and error. After the project I feel like I have a better handle on how things work and am ready to tackle the next one.
